# CactoblastisGenpopTest
This is a repository used for the Molecular Evolution course. In this repository are the scripts to run analyzes of population genetics and molecular evolution of Cactoblastis cactorum, an invasive species that consumes Opuntia cladodes. Each of the folders corresponds to a bioinformatic processing step, from raw data cleaning to selection analyses.
